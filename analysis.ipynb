In the ED, he was initially stable, but he began to become increasingly agitated and aggressive. He received haloperidol and ativan, but remained combative. His O2 sats never dipped below 90% but he became even more agitated, diaphoretic and, after discussion with the pt's daughter, the decision was made to intubate him so a w/u of his fall could be undertaken.  There was some concern about O2 sats in the low 90s, and after a d-dimer returned at 1000, a CTPA was done. It was negative. A head CT revealed no acute change. Hip films revealed.  He was admitted to the ICU intubated.   Past Medical History: Dementia COPD CHF (EF unknown) Osteoarthritis s/p L hip replacement h/o TIA   Social History: Lives at dementia  facility  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: afebrile BP: 140/52 HR: 60 RR: 12 O2sat 93% general: sedated, intubated HEENT: PERLL, anicteric, MMM Lungs: CTA anteriorly Heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly Extremities: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema   Pertinent Results:  08:45PM BLOOD WBC-12.9* RBC-4.94 Hgb-15.6 Hct-44.5 MCV-90 MCH-31.5 MCHC-35.0 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-195  08:45PM BLOOD D-Dimer-1009*  08:45PM BLOOD Glucose-129* UreaN-19 Creat-1.2 Na-140 K-4.2 Cl-100 HCO3-28 AnGap-16  08:45PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-101  08:45PM BLOOD CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01 proBNP-72  12:05AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-524* pCO2-36 pH-7.44 calTCO2-25 Base XS-1  CT head: 1.

Gallstones.  Hip films: No acute fracture or dislocation of right hip. Consider MRI if symptoms persist.  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 88 year-old man with history of dementia, COPD and CHF (EF unknown) who presented from his nursing home after falling and having some right-sided weakness. In the ED, he became agitated and combative and was intubated for workup.  ## Agitation, intubation: CTA revealed no avute pathology. He was extubated without difficulty.  ## s/p fall: Hip films and CT head were unremarkable. Likely mechanical fall. No events on telemetry.  ## COPD: Extent of COPD unknown. Takes no meds at baseline. Reason for intubation was not hypoxia.  ## Cardiomyopathy: presumed ischemic in nature. Unknown EF, but BNP <100 suggested no significant volume overload. He was continued on atorvastatin 10.  Medications on Admission: Furosemide 40 gm PO qd Atorvastatin 10 mg PO qd Quetiapine 25 mg PO qd Sertraline 100 mg PO qd   Discharge Medications: 1.
